--cryptography--
Your data is important so you need
to protect it. Bramble is here for
you. Encrypt your files quickly
to be only accessible by the
password holder

--hide file in a file--
Your data is important so you need
to protect it, but they are sensitive
too. So why not hide them? With this
feature you can hide your file in a
jpg picture and protect it with a
password.

--forensic tools--
When you suppress data this data is not
really suppressed, the space is released
but as long as no other file takes this
space the data can be recovered.
In fact it's really impressive what you
can recovered in an usb stick...

--wifi jammer--
Stop the access to an access point.
It isn't a phisical wifi jammer, it
doesn't jamm the waves because it's
totally illegal. This feature uses
Denial of service attacks. You can
jamm a remote wifi or your own wifi
where you are connected.
--wifi attack--

--evil twin--
It's pretty difficult to crack
the wifi password. That's why
we choose to attack the weakness
of every system : the human.
Bramble stop the access to the
access point and create a copy.
the target will have to connect
to our access point and
enter the wifi key to access
the internet.

--fake access point--

--sniffer--
Captures network traffic.
You can capture the names
of visited sites or http
passwords to check what your
child is doing on the internet

--gain access--
gain network access with network
backdoor or gain computer access
with a bruteforce ssh. With the
network backdoor you can controll
your bramble on another network and
use all features provide with BrambleS

--key cloner--
copy all data from an usb device
to another. It' a feature
as simple as usefull.
