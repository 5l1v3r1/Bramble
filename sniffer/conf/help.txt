Packet sniffing allows individuals
to capture data as it is transmitted
over a network. This technique is used
by network professionals to diagnose
network issues, and by malicious users
to capture unencrypted data, like
passwords and usernames. If this
information is captured in transit,
a user can gain access to a system
or network.

In our case you can use the sniffer to know
if your pc is infected by malware, to
see which sites your child visits,
or see if someone use your network
without your permission.

Please do not use it to steal data that
does not belong to you.
