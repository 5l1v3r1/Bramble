Key cloner Help

For the moment 3 modes exist.

-Firstly plug the usb device you
want to copy.

-Then if you want to copy it to another
usb disk, plug this usb device and select
the option "usb to usb".

-Else if you want to copy to your bramble device,
select the option "usb to internal storage".
So you can find the copy in the directory
/bramble/result/cloner/nameOfTheKey
/!\ Be carefull the space on your device is limited.
So use this option if you don't have the choice.

-So now choose the target (and the Destination)

-Wait the end of the operation. If you interupt the process,
the copy will be incomplete.
